This repo containts scripts for the simulations and analyses in "Biophysical constraints on mRNA decay rates shape macroevolutionary divergence in steady-state abundances", Felce et al. 

The scripts for simulations, and the scripts for fitting the simulated data with the various models, are included in the simulations folder. This includes scripts for plotting the true vs estimated parameter plots and the AIC comparison plots in the supplement.
