This repo containts scripts for the simulations and analyses in "Biophysical constraints on mRNA decay rates shape macroevolutionary divergence in steady-state abundances", Felce et al. 

The scripts for simulations, and the scripts for fitting the simulated data with the various models, are included in the simulations folder. This includes scripts for plotting the true vs estimated parameter plots and the AIC comparison plots in the supplement.

The data used in the phylogenetic modeling, and the scripts for fitting the OU models to data are included in the phylogenetic_input folder. This includes the script for creating Figure 2 of the main manuscript.

The fits for the expression-binned data, along with the script for producing Figure 3, is included in Figure_3.
